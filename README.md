# InsurancePricePrediction

The problem statement here is that we have a dataset of some people with certain attributes. Using machine learning in Python, we have to find out relevant information from this dataset and also have to:

1. To predict the insurance price a person will have to pay.
2. How well can our ML algorithms predict medical expenses?
3. Checking the accuracy.

 In this project, I worked on developing an end to end machine learning model using linear regression, Random Forest Regression and XG Boost Regression.
